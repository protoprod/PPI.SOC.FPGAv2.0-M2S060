Instrumenting design `m2s010_som' in directory C:\Users\gcallsen\Documents\Projects\FPGA\ModelSimRecovery\synthesis\synthesis_2
The target device family is 'SmartFusion2' (and considered a ProAsic3-based family; hence we do care about UJTAG / UJTAG_WRAPPER instances).
The design does not contain a UJTAG_WRAPPER instance.
OK, the design does not contain a UJTAG instance.
