                    SmartFusion2 MSS GPIO interrupt example
================================================================================

This example project demonstrates the use of the SmartFusion2 MSS GPIO
interrupts. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project requires MMUART0 to be connected to a host PC. The host PC
must connect to the serial port using a terminal emulator such as HyperTerminal
or PuTTY configured as follows:
    - 57600 baud
    - 8 data bits
    - 1 stop bit
    - no parity
    - no flow control

The example project will display instructions over the serial port. Press one of
the switches on the board to generate an interrupt. The interrupt service routine
will display a message when the interrupt occurs. Each switch generates an
interrupt of a different type:
    - SW1: edge positive interrupt.
    - SW2: edge negative interrupt.
    - SW3: both edge positive and negative interrupt.
    - SW4: level low interrupt.

                                Target hardware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project is targeted at a SmartFusion2 Developemnt Kit design which
has MMUART0 enabled and connected to a host PC. The example project is built for
a design using a SmartFusion2 MSS APB clock frequency of 83MHz. Trying to
execute this example project on a different design will result in incorrect baud
rate being used by MMUART0 or no output if MMUART0 is not enabled and connected.

It also expects MSS GPIO 8 to MSS GPIO 12 to be configured as inputs connected
to switches 1 to 5 as follows:
    MSS_GPIO8:  connected to switch SW1 using SmartFusion2 pin W6
    MSS_GPIO9:  connected to switch SW2 using SmartFusion2 pin AA1
    MSS_GPIO10: connected to switch SW3 using SmartFusion2 pin AA2
    MSS_GPIO11: connected to switch SW4 using SmartFusion2 pin AB1
    MSS_GPIO12: connected to switch SW5 using SmartFusion2 pin AB2
    
This example project can be used with another design using a different clock
configuration. This can be achieved by overwriting the content of this example
project's "drivers_config/sys_config" folder with the one generated by Libero
as part of your design's creation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Redirecting MMUART0 to RS232 connector on SmartFusion2 Development Kit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that it is possible to redirect MMUART0 to the J198 RS232 connector
on the SmartFusion2 Development Kit despite J198 being connected to the MMUART1
SmartFusion2 pads. This can be done in your hardware design by selecting to
direct the MMUART0 TXD and RXD signals to the FPGA fabric and then connecting
these signals to top level ports assigned to pin H30 for TXD and pin G29 for
RXD.

                          Silicon revision dependencies
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This example is built to execute on an M2S050T_ES die (M2S050T revision B). You
will need to overwrite this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and
"CMSIS" folders with the one generated by Libero for your hardware design if
using a newer silicon revision.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" for
your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
